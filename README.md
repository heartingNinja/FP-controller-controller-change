# FPcontroller-ChangeController
This is a very basic first person controller with animations. The animator controller needs to be set up in Unity. Also code that will allow you to change from one camera to another at same place and rotation. This code can be used to change from 1st to 3rd person, or different charcter models. 

FP.controller is for animations



PlayerChange.cs goes to an empty Game Object to change PlayerMode



PlayerControllerFP.cs is for movemnt and look. It works with a Charcter Controller
